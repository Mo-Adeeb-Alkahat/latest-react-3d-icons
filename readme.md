A simple and easy-to-use library for adding 3d icons to any React project.

## Example

![Gif Demonstration](https://i.imgur.com/P6y8rJk.gif)

The library provides thousands of icons for you to use, or you can upload any svg you want and it will do the rest.

## Installation

This library requires ThreeJS and React-Three-Fiber to already be installed in the project.

```sh
npm install three @react-three/fiber react-3d-icons
```

## How to use

Import the main Icon react element:

```javascript
import { Icon } from "react-3d-icons";
```

Import icons (see below for a list):

```javascript
import { twitter } from "react-3d-icons";
```

Create a div or container element with a width/height, the icon's canvas will fill its parent.

Add the Icon element and specify your icon, as well as any other parameters you want.

```javascript
<div style={{ height: "100px", width: "100px" }}>
  <Icon file={twitter} color={"#1DA1F2"} scale={10} />
</div>
```

Voila! Your icon is now display and can be treated as any other image or text element.

## Opening Link

You can pass any url into the 'link' property of the Icon element, and clicking on the icon will open that link in a new tab.

```javascript
<Icon file={npm} link='https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-3d-icons' />
```

## Icons

The npm package comes pre-configured will all of the icons from [simpleicons.org](https://simpleicons.org/)  
The names are lowercase, without spaces, and numbers (and periods) have been converted to words.  
(Ex: Twitter -> twitter, Google Maps -> googlemaps, About.me -> aboutdotme, 1Password -> onepassword)

Additionally, you can import your own SVGs, and pass references to them into the 'file' property.

React Example:

```javascript
import { mylogo } from "./icons/logo.svg";

<Icon file='mylogo' />;
```

## Customization

The Icon component comes with properties which you can customize to change how your icon looks and behaves.

| rotation        | An array of the X, Y, and Z rotation of your icon.
